\section{Gameplay}




Movement and jumping will be implemented using Unity's 2D physics engine to handle.

Re-activating components of the ship has a probability of activating some of the ship's security measures. These will include activating traps or spawning hostile defence drones. On reaching the next component these security systems can be deactivated.

We plan to use 2d sprites, with normal maps created using \textit{SpriteLamp} for the game's lighting effects. Figure~\ref{fig:player} shows an example of it's use.
