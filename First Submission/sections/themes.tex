In our game the player controls a maintenance robot on board a spaceship on a long journey. While on the journey the ship malfunctions and begins shutting down, the whole crew are in stasis and it is up to the robot to restore power.

The player must traverse the ship, reactivating components and lighting the ship up in the process. The gameplay takes inspiration from exploration based platformer games such as \textit{Spelunker}.
